Step 1: Start Metro Bundler

  In your first terminal, run:
  npx react-native start --reset-cache

  Step 2: Run Android App

  In a second terminal (keep Metro running), run:
  npx react-native run-android

  Alternative: If you want to run on web instead

  If you prefer to test the web version first:
  npm run web

  Troubleshooting Commands

  If you encounter any issues, try these in sequence:

  1. Clean everything first:
  cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install

  2. Check Android device/emulator:
  adb devices

  3. If build fails, try:
  cd android && ./gradlew :app:generateDebugAssets && cd ..
  npx react-native run-android

  Which platform would you like to run first - Android or web?
