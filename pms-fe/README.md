## 📱 **User Interface & Navigation**

### **Role-Based Navigation**
The app automatically adapts its interface based on user roles:

- **Employee**: Dashboard, My Requests, Create Request, Profile (4 tabs)
- **Supervisor**: + My Team tab for approvals and team management (5 tabs)
- **Admin**: + All Requests, All Users for system management (6 tabs)

### **Key Features**
- **Worksite-Friendly Design**: Large touch targets, high contrast, simple navigation
- **Offline-First**: Critical features work without internet connection
- **Material Design**: Consistent, professional UI using React Native Paper
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded request statuses with text labels
- **Responsive**: Works on various Android screen sizes

## 🔧 **Key Components**

### **Authentication System**
- JWT token management with automatic refresh
- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage
- "Forgot Password" workflow through supervisor approval
- Auto-login on app startup

### **Request Management**
- Complete request lifecycle management
- State machine validation for status transitions
- Approval chain visualization
- Revision tracking and handling

### **State Management**
- Redux Toolkit for efficient state updates
- Redux Persist for offline data persistence
- Typed hooks for type-safe development
- Optimistic updates with error rollback

### **API Integration**
- Axios-based service with interceptors
- Automatic JWT token refresh
- Request retry logic
- Network status detection
- Offline queue management

## 🏃 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- React Native development environment

npm run lint

# Testing
npm test
```

## 🔐 **Security Features**
- JWT token secure storage
- Role-based component rendering
- Input validation and sanitization
- Network request encryption (HTTPS)
- Sensitive data masking

## 📊 **Performance Optimizations**
- Lazy loading for screens and components
- Virtual lists for large datasets
- Image optimization and caching
- API request debouncing
- Memory management for long sessions

## 🎯 **Design Principles**

### **Simplicity First**
- Minimal required fields and interactions
- Automatic approval chain determination
- Visual status indicators
- No complex dropdowns for worksite users

### **Offline-Friendly**
- Password resets work through physical supervisor interaction
- Critical features available without internet
- Local data caching with sync

### **Security Through Hierarchy**
- Users only see data at their level and below
- Supervisors verify identity physically
- Single admin maintains system control

## 🚧 **Next Steps**

To continue development, focus on these areas in order:

1. **Complete Request Forms**: Implement full create/edit request functionality
2. **Request Details**: Build comprehensive request view with actions
3. **Supervisor Features**: Add team management and approval workflows
4. **Admin Features**: Implement system-wide management tools
5. **Offline Sync**: Add robust offline capabilities
6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage
7. **Performance**: Optimize for production deployment

## 📞 **API Integration**

The app is designed to work with the Django backend located at `../pms-be/`. Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000` for development, or update the API_CONFIG in `src/constants/api.ts` for production.

## 🛠️ **Development Notes**

- All components use TypeScript for type safety
- Redux store is persisted for offline functionality
- Navigation is role-based and automatically adapts
- Material Design ensures consistent, professional UI
- Error handling includes user-friendly notifications
- The codebase follows React Native best practices

This foundation provides a solid base for building a comprehensive procurement management mobile application that meets the specific needs of worksite operations while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
