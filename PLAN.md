- [x] Cross-platform compatibility fixes (React version alignment, web storage)
- [x] Working development server at http://localhost:3000
- [x] Language switching functionality (English ↔ Turkish)
- [x] Authentication system (login screen, JWT handling, form validation)
- [x] API service layer (axios client, token management, error handling)
- [x] Authentication routing (login/dashboard navigation)
- [ ] Core screens implementation (dashboard variations by user role)
- [ ] Request management UI (create, list, approve workflows)
- [ ] Navigation setup (role-based tabs)
- [ ] Testing setup
- [ ] Deployment configuration

### Notes
- Use react-i18next for internationalization with JSON translation files
- Store language preference in localStorage (web) / AsyncStorage (mobile)
- Implement device language detection on first app launch
- Consider Turkish language specific UI adjustments (longer text strings)
- All user-facing strings must use translation keys from day one
- Plan for future language additions with extensible translation structure
- Web-first development approach for rapid iteration (code identical for mobile)
- React 19.1.1 + react-dom for proper compatibility with React Native Web

### Current Development Status
✅ **Foundation Ready**: Full React Native setup with TypeScript, internationalization
✅ **Web Development**: Hot-reload server running at http://localhost:3000
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase works on web, will work identically on iOS/Android
✅ **Language Support**: English/Turkish switching with persistent preferences
✅ **Development Speed**: Fast browser-based iteration vs slow mobile simulators

### Next Priorities
1. Authentication system (login screen, JWT handling)
2. API integration layer (axios client, base URL config)
3. Navigation setup (role-based tabs)
4. Core screens (dashboard variations by user role)
5. Request management UI (create, list, approve workflows)

## Key Translation Categories
- Authentication (login, password reset, etc.)
- Request management (statuses, forms, actions)
- Navigation labels
- Error messages
- Success messages
- Form validation messages
- Dashboard content
- Settings and profile options

This plan provides a complete, production-ready React Native application with full English/Turkish language support that matches the backend's capabilities while maintaining the simplicity and offline-friendly design principles of the PMS system.
